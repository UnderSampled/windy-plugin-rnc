# RNC Charts for Windy.com

Currently only NOAA charts are supported. If there is enough interest, I can look into adding
support for Navionics charts.

To use, add `windy-plugin-rnc` into the "Load plugin directly from npm" option in Windy.
Then, enable "RNC Nautical Charts" from the additional layers menu.
